    This page serves as a rolling journal of thoughts and ideas from my daily
    flights of mathematical lunacy. By no means am I an expert in any of these fields.
    This will be a more informal and casual approach to some advanced mathematical
    topics in my own words. Yes there will be mistakes here and there, this is not
    peer reviewed or nearly as rigorous as a research level report. So take everything
    with a grain of salt. However, I hope this encourages you to learn something
    new about an interesting field of math or maybe learn about fields of math
    you never knew existed. Always feel free to reach out if you have questions
    or thoughts, I love discussing mathematics and I love learning from others.
    Cheers.
