            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                I am currently a mathematics PhD. student at Florida
                Institute of Technology. I did both my B.S. and M.S. in mathematics
                both at the University of Utah where I completed projects in optimization
                and topological data analysis. I am in my last year of coursework
                and will be transitioning to full-time research thereafter. My
                mathematical interests are operator algebras, noncommutative geometry
                (Connes), mathematical physics and deep/reinforcement learning.
                Beyond my PhD., I am either interested in a post-doctoral fellowship
                or private research at an aerospace company. I am certain things
                will change and I won't follow the exact path I anticipate but I
                am eager to see where a career in mathematics will take me. If you
                would like to collaborate or have any inquiries please feel free
                to reach out, I would love to connect and talk about math or any
                of my hobbies or interests.
            </p>
