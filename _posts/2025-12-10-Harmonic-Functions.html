    If you are involved in the world of mathematics and science at all then you
    have more than likely heard about the Langlands Program. Langlands aims to connect
    algebra and representation theory to harmonic analysis and classical analysis.
    If this means nothing to you then don't worry. I was in the same boat. Today
    I want to look at the <i>harmonic</i> part of harmonic analysis. The neat part
    about harmonic functions is that we need only a basic calculus level of knowledge
    to define, and understand the basics of harmonic functions. I will however, be
    a little verbose at times.
</p>

<p>
    We first need to define the <i>Laplcian operator</i>. The Laplacian acts on a 
    $C^2$ (twice differentiable) function by summing all of the homogeneous
    second derivatives, explicitly, we have
    $$
        \Delta f = \sum_{j=1}^n \left( \frac{\partial f}{\partial x_j}\right)^2
    $$
    That notation is a mess but it really is just the sum of homogeneous
    second derivatives of $f$. Further, we say a function $f$ is <i>harmonic</i>
    if $\Delta f = 0$. For a concrete example, lets take $f(x,y)=x^3-3xy^2$.
    Now lets compute the derivatives
    $$
        \begin{align*}
            f_x &= 3x^2 - 3y^2\\
            f_{xx} &= 6x\\
            f_y &= -6xy\\
            f_{yy} &= 6x
        \end{align*}
    $$
    Now we just sum $f_{xx}+f_{yy} = 6x - 6x = 0$. So $f$ is in fact harmonic.
    This is pretty straightforward, but its the properties of harmonic functions
    that we are most interested in. I could just give a laundry list of things but
    a few properties I would like to give some motivation behind.
</p>

<p>
    A huge amount of the convenient properties of harmonic functions were discovered
    or motivated by the study of PDE's. So I want to start with one of the most
    basic properties of harmonic functions, one that is used extensively in basic
    PDE thoery. We call this first property the <strong>Mean Value Property</strong>.
</p>

<p>
  <ins><strong>Def:</strong></ins> A harmonic function $f \in C^2(\mathbb{R})$
  satisfies the \<strong>\<em>mean value property</em></strong>:
  $$
    f(x) = \fint_{\partial B(x,r)} f(y) dS(y) = \fint_{B(x,r)} f(y)dy
  $$
  where $B(x,r)$ is the ball centered at $x$ with radius $r$.
</p>

<p>
    The weird looking integral sign is just the average value integral and the 
    $dS(y)$ indicates a surface measure. In not so many words, the average value
    of a harmonic function around the boundary of the ball $B(x,r)$ is the same as
    the average value everywhere inside the ball.
