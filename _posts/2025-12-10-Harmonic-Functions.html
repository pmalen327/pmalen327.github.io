    If you are involved in the world of mathematics and science at all then you
    have more than likely heard about the Langlands Program. Langlands aims to connect
    algebra and representation theory to harmonic analysis and classical analysis.
    If this means nothing to you then don't worry. I was in the same boat. Today
    I want to look at the <i>harmonic</i> part of harmonic analysis. The neat part
    about harmonic functions is that we need only a basic calculus level of knowledge
    to define, and understand the basics of harmonic functions. I will however, be
    a little verbose at times.

    We first need to define the <i>Laplcian operator</i>. The Laplacian acts on a 
    $\C^2$ function by summing all of the second derivatives, explicitly, we have
    $$
        \Delta f = \sum_{j=1}^n \left( \frac{\partial f}{\partial x_j}\right)^2
    $$
    That notation is a mess but it really is just the sum of second derivatives of $f$.
    Further, we say a function $f$ is <i>harmonic</i> if $\Delta f = 0$.
