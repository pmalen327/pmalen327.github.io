title: "Basic Classification of Operators in $C^*$-Algebras"
---

<p>
    Ok I have finally migrated things over to a github.io repo and now things are infinitely
    easier on my end. So as a sort of "test-drive", I will walk through the basic
    classification of operators in $C^*$-algebras with respect to the given involution.
    I will also give some statements of some fundamental theorems in operator algebra
    theory.
