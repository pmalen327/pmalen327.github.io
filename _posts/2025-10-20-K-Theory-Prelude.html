    $K$-theory is one of those fields of mathematics that has always seemed too deep
    and not at all approachable for me. As it turns out, it has a relatively low
    barrier for entry but of course one could still study it their whole life and
    barely make a dent. There are a few flavors of $K$-theory. We usually split
    it into topological and algebraic $K$-theory. Ok great, well what does that mean?
    Hatcher defined topological $K$-theory as a cohomology theory for vector bundles
    and algebraic $K$-theory as a homology theory for varieties. Once again, what 
    does that mean? Well before we get into that, first lets narrow the scope and
    just focuse on topological $K$-theory. Great, now all we have to do is learn
    about cohomology of vector bundles, should be easy enough.
</p>

<p>
    I will assume we are ok with the basic theory of vector bundles, specifically
    complex bundles. If you don't know what that is then fret not, we really only
    need the definition to start talking about the objects of interest. As a refresher,
    maybe I will define vector bundles.
</p>

<p>
  <ins><strong>Def:</strong></ins> A <strong><em>vector bundle</em></strong> is a
  triplet $\xi = (E,\pi,B)$ with
    <ul>
        <li>$E$ a topological space, usually a manifold, sometimes called the "total"
        space $E(\xi)$</li>
        <li>$B$ a topological space, sometimes called the "base" space</li>
        <li>A continuous surjection $\pi:E \to B$ where the fibres over each $b \in B$
            are isomorphic to $\mathbb{C}^n$
        </li>
    </ul>
</p>

<p>
    There are a few more details regarding local trivializations etc. but we can
    go over that if needed. Usually, I denote vector bundles with just $E$ and this
    is also a pretty standard practice. But keep in mind that its technically a
    triplet of two topological spaces and some kind of projection.
</p>

<p>
    Ok now we can finally move on to some $K$-theory stuff. Let $X$ be the base space (a compact Hausdorff space)
    and let $E$ and $F$ be complex vector bundles over $X$. The addition $[E]+[F] = E \oplus F$
    is well defined. Well defined enough in fact that we even get a semigroup under
    the direct sum. This is great, but we can do even better. The question is, how
    can we complete this and actually form and abelian group? Thanks to King Grothendieck,
    we can build and abelian group $K(X)$ from the semigroup of vector bundles.
    $K(X)$ is the Grothendieck group of isomorphism classes of vector bundles over 
    $X$. This is called the <em>first $K$-theory of $X$</em>. Ok this is also great
    but how is this a group? Grothendieck defined an equivalence relation on the
    vector bundles that essentially gives us a "subtraction" operation, thus giving
    additive inverses to elements of $K(X)$.
</p>

<p>
    We say two vector bundles $E$ and $F$ are <em>stably isomorphic</em> if there 
    exists some $n$ such that $E \oplus \mathbb{C}^n \cong F \oplus \mathbb{C}^n$.
    Further, we define the cancellation law via
    $$
        (E-E')+(F-F') = (E\oplus F)-(E' \oplus F')
    $$
    Where $[E]-[F] = [E']-[F']$ if there exists a bundle $G$ such that
    $$
        E\oplus F' \oplus G \cong E' \oplus F \oplus G
    $$
    So $K(X)$ becomes a group under this cancellation law. As it turns out,
    $K(X)$ is even a commutative ring with unit with multiplication defined via
    the tensor product
    $$
        ([E]-[F])\cdot ([G]-[H]) = [E \otimes G] + [F \otimes H] - [E\otimes H] - [F \otimes G]
    $$
    I should mention too that the elements of $K(X)$ are not vector bundles, but
    rather formal differences of vector bundles $[E]-[F]$.
</p>

<p>
    We usually refer to such $G$ as some kind of <em>stabilizer</em>. So while $E$
    and $F$ may have horribly mismatched dimension and topologies, $G$ may be nice
    enough to get around this. If dimensions and topologies agree, then $G$ is usually
    just the zero or trivial bundle, but if they don't agree then we need some more
    sophistication encoded in $G$. Lets look at a quick example.
</p>

<p>
    Let $X=S^2$, $E$ be the Hopf line bundle (you don't need to know what this is exactly,
    but its the usualy line bundle with twist), and $\varepsilon^n$ be the $n$-dimensional
    trivial line bundle. Consider the pairs $(E,\varepsilon^1)$ and $(\varepsilon^2, \varepsilon^1 \oplus \varepsilon^1)$.
    Recall also that $E \oplus \varepsilon^1 \cong \varepsilon^2$. For these two pairs
    to be stably isomorphic, we need a $G$ such that
    $$
        E \oplus (\varepsilon^1 \oplus \varepsilon^1) \oplus G \cong \varepsilon^2 \oplus \varepsilon^1 \oplus G
    $$
    So clearly we can't take $G$ to be the zero bundle, we need something nice yet
    nontrivial. If we choose $G=\varepsilon^1$ then we actually get $\varepsilon^3$ on both
    sides and thus the desired isomorphism. So in a nutshell, we need a $G$ that
    gives enough "space" and topology to undo any weird knots or homotopies in the
    vector bundles. Note that existence of $G$ is only guaranteed under certain
    conditions and there are plenty of theorems that give us more insight into
    when we can have such a $G$.

    Now I just want to mention two important results in $K$-theory. First, consider
    the map
    $$
        \mu : K(X) \otimes K(S^2) \to K(X \times S^2)
    $$
    As it turns out, $\mu$ is actually an isopmorphism. This means $K(X) \otimes K(S^2)$
    is actually isomorphic to $K(X \times S^2)$. This is suspiciously neat, but 
    actually leads to an even cooler result.
</p>

<p>
    Perhaps the most important and deep result in $K$-theory is <strong><em>Bott periodicity</em></strong>.
    Bott says that
    $$
        K(S^n) \cong K(S^{n+2})
    $$
    for ALL nontrivial $n$. Ok how the hell does this work. Well I looked up a few
    different flavors of the proof and it is far from simple. There are multiple
    approaches to the proof using tools from different fields of math, while they
    are well known and documented, they are extremely deep and difficult. This makes
    sense however, it is very rare that such a nice theorem has a simple and clean 
    proof. While any given proof of Bott is extremely technical, they have all been
    described as beautiful. For me it is one of those theorems that still just absolutely
    blows my mind. On the surface it seems like there's no world where this should
    hold, so the fact it holds for all $n$ is just ridiculous, its so cool. Its
    always a good idea to look for counter examples to proved theorems in order to
    deepen your understanding so I did exactly that. Every example I worked out
    just continued to blow my mind. Using $\mu$ to construct sphere isopmorphisms
    over chosen base spaces then finding $K$-theories for each is just a really
    cool loop. Ok this is neat but what about for real vector bundles? As it turns out, Bott
    covers that too, but we have 8-periodic isopmorphisms as opposed to 2. Specifically,
    $$
        KO(S^n) \cong KO(S^{n+8})
    $$
    Here, $KO$ just means the real $K$-theory rather than the general complex case.
    This difference also has some deep theory and I still don't understand hardly any
    of it. 
</p>

<p>
    We always see periodicity in mathematics, trigonometry is usually
    where we are first exposed to it. But this is one of the most fascinating examples
    of periodicity I have come across to date. I hope to one day be able to understand
    one of the proofs of Bott periodicity but for now its beauty will continue to
    torment me.
