<h1>Bio</h1>
<p>
    My personal interests are very broad. My outdoor hobbies include
    skiing, skydiving, longboarding, shooting, and running. I really
    love anything that gets me outdoors and moving. On the flip side,
    I also have a lot of nerdy hobbies that trap me indoors for hours
    on end. I enjoy the occasional programming project, reading, gaming,
    and anything related to mathematics. Further, I am currently working
    on launching a brand to provide tools for mathematics students of
    all levels. I also maintain (and continuously accrue) a large collection
    of shoes, Star Wars figures, Legos, and Pok√©mon cards.
